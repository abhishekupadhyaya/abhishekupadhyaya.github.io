				<h2>AWS Data Pipeline</h2>
                <p>I am currently working on this project for <a href="http://pearsonlab.github.io/">Pearson Lab at Duke University</a>. I am using Amazon Web Services tools such as S3, Lambda, EC2, RDS, and DynamoDB to store, process, and analyze large amount of data. To support the pipeline, I have designed a web application using Python Flask to query and download the data from S3. I have also written Python scripts to automate the processes of restoring DB snapshots as well as starting, stopping EC2 instances</p>
                <p>The code to upload the files to S3 including the python scripts used in AWS Lambda to redirect meta-data to RDS and DynamoDB are in <a href="https://github.com/pearsonlab/DataPipeline-upload">this GitHub repository</a>. Similarly, the code to query the database and download the files from AWS S3 are in <a href="https://github.com/pearsonlab/DataPipeline-download"> this GitHub repository</a>.</p>

                <h2>Employee On-boarding Web Application</h2>
                <p>I worked as a Software Development Intern at <a href= "http://www.incessanttechnologies.com/">Incessant Technologies</a> during the summer of 2015, where I and two other interns created Employee On-boarding Web Application to support company's existing employee portal. The following video demonstrates how the application works.</p>

				<h2><a href = "https://sites.duke.edu/dukeresearch/2016/04/05/the-art-of-asking-questions-at-datafest-2016/">Best Use of Outside Data</a></h2>
                <p>I along with four other team members used Google Trends’ data as well as Random forests technique to analyze the given events’ dates and AdWords from <a href="http://www.ticketmaster.com/"> Ticketmaster’s</a> data during <a href="https://www2.stat.duke.edu/datafest/"> ASA DataFest 2016</a> at Duke University. We used Python and MATLAB to extract and visualize the data. We were awarded with Best use of outside Data.</p>

                <h2>Yeti Hunt</h2>
                <p> This is my first multilevel java game: Yeti Hunt - a 2D scrolling-schooting game made for Software Design course. It has 2 distinct levels with different difficulty levels. The code for this is available in my GitHub account.</p>

                <h2>SLogo</h2>
                <p> I designed the front end portion using JavaFX and CSS for the application that provides an integrated development environment for users to write SLogo (similar to logo) programs.</p>

                <h2>Ethernet Switch - Forwarding Subsystem</h2>
                <p> I designed and wrote VHDL code for the interface between Receive and Forwarding side of Ethernet switch. The code handled the transfer of data from Receive subsystem to the Forwarding subsystem in the switch. The code for this is available in my Github account.</p>

                <h2>How is the economy doing? - web application</h2>
                <p> I designed the front-­end of a web application using HTML/CSS/JavaScript during Georgetown Hackathon, Spring 2016. The website gives simplified information about the US economy based on the economic data since 1930. In the back-end, machine learning algorithm is used to crunch the data into simple probablistic data. I used Express - ­Node.js web application framework to host the website. Click on the image to access the website.

                <p> I performed Photo-CELIV experiments and simulated the experimental data to calculate the mobility of organic solar cell, which would determine the efficiency of organic solar cells. 
				I also experimentally analyzed the effects of different surfactants on the performance of organic solar cells based on the blended film deposited by RIR-MAPLE technique. The analysis of different surfactants is shown in the following slideshow.
